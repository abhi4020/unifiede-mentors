# Student-Teacher Booking (Minimal)

This is a minimal student–teacher booking demo app built with Node.js, Express and SQLite. It intentionally does not use Firebase.

Prereqs
- Node.js (14+)

Quick start (PowerShell on Windows):

```powershell
cd 'c:\Users\admin\Desktop\Student-teacher-booking'
npm install
npm run init-db
npm start
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

Notes / next steps
- No authentication is included. In production add auth and input validation.
- Consider moving to a hosted DB for multi-instance deployments.
